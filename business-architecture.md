# Business Architecture


A Business Architecture defines the structure of your organization in
terms of its governance structure, business processes, business services
and products, business information and stakeholders. A business
architecture outlines the relation to strategic goals towards a working
system. So in short a business architecture can be regarded as a
blueprint of the working of an organization. By using a business
architecture your organisation can handle changes and problems with less
cost and in less time since you know all the important dependencies,
relation and information flows.  Every successful organisation, small or
large, SHOULD have a business architecture. A business architecture does
not have to be fully descriptive, complete or created among a certain
standard. Designing organisations and describing the working of an
organisation is know to be complex and hard. However simple tools exist
to create a meaningful business architecture for your organisation.

This section is created to speed up the process for creating a real
business architecture.

You can use one of the following tools:

-   Business architecture template(s)
-   (Re)use  business principles
-   Modeling your business processes
-   Defining your business products

## Tools for creating a business architecture


To speed up the process of creating your business architecture you can
make use of one of the following tools:

-   [(Generic) Business principles](https://nocomplexity.com/business-principles/)
-   [Collection]( https://principles.design/) of many nice design principles used by companies (180+ examples). 
-   [Archi](http://www.archimatetool.com/).  Archi™ GUI tool for
    creating a business architecture using the ArchiMate
    modelling™ language. The Archi tool is targeted toward all levels
    of Architects. The tool is MIT Licensed, so it provides a low cost
    solution to users who are looking for a free, open ArchiMate
    modeling tool.
-   [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.org/download/modeler/). Camunda
    Modeler is an OSS desktop application for editing BPMN
    process diagrams(2.0) and DMN decision tables. It is very easy to
    use, which means that business analysts can use it as well as
    developers, working on the same diagrams. Camunda Modeler is part of
    an open source platform for workflow and business
    process management. So when you use the [Camunda
    suite](https://camunda.org/) you can also use the execution engine
    for your processes you have modeled.
-   [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/). Protégé is an OSS web or
    desktop application that can be used for building
    business ontologies.

## Business architecture templates


Creating a business architecture means doing real business research.
However for a quality business architecture it make sense to make use of
a draft template. From a template you can easily add, remove or change
subjects that need special attention within your context. Also since
architecture documents always should be created for a clear business
goal and to be used by different stakeholders, all quality documents
SHOULD contain some default reusable text blocks.

-   [Stakeholder
    template](https://nocomplexity.com/stakeholder-template/)
-   [Business Architecture.](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/BA%20for%20validation.pdf_en)
    EU template/document that describes the product, service strategy,
    organizational, functional, process, information, and geographic
    aspects of the business architecture.

## Using business viewpoints


Viewpoints can provide benefit to address specific concerns for certain
stakeholders. Below a list of most used viewpoint within a business
architecture:

-   Motivation view: describes what the business achieves for itself and
    its stakeholders (direct and indirect value).
-   Capability view: describes how the business delivers direct and
    indirect value in response to the challenges of the environment.
-   Activity view: describes the day-to-day behaviour of the business.
-   Responsibility view: captures the relationships between individuals
    and organizations in terms of responsibilities and commitments.
    These  relationships and organizational interfaces may be
    represented as business services.
